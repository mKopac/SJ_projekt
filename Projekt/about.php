                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Story follows life of the
                            4077th MASH (MASH is short for Mobile Army Surgical Hospital) during Korean
                            war in years 1950-1953. However this unit is not the military outfit someone would
                            expect. When not on duty the local medical personel engages in activities varying
                            from playing golf in a minefield, to performing practical jokes on anyone. But their
                            most distinct characteristic is complete lack of discipline. There are many various
                            characters living in the camp but the most important are:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li> Hawkeye Pierce and his friend Trapper John are sugeons who have been drafted from their
                                civilian practices and are not afraid to tell anyone, not even a general, what they
                                think
                                about the army and war without any fear. In their tent called "The Swamp" they assembled
                                their very own still which they use to supply the whole camp with gin.

                            <li> Their roommate of Hawkeye and Trapper is Major Frank Burns. Frank is an extremly
                                patriotic, rule following but somewhat cowardly doctor. He is often made fun of because
                                of
                                his surgical incompetence and being very annoying to everone else.

                            <li> Commander of the camp is Lt. Colonel Henry Blake, a good doctor but an indecisive
                                leader.
                                Henry is a enjoyer of good drink, playing golf and fishing. Since he's also a draftee he
                                stands firm with Hawkeye and Trapper in their mischiefs against Frank and Margaret.

                            <li> Aided by Corporal "Radar" O'Reilly an 18 year old from Iowa with a special ability
                                which
                                no one can really understand, he can tell what's going to happen or what is someone
                                going
                                to say before it happens. Often speculated that it is actually him who runs the unit and
                                uses Henry just for signatures.

                            <li> Major Margaret Houlihan is the chief nurse of the hospital. Because the army is her
                                career
                                she has to act tough, follow every rule and regulation and not let emotions come to
                                surface.
                                She and Frank are desperately trying to keep their relationship secret, not willing to
                                acknowledge the fact that everyone knows about it.

                            <li> Corporal Klinger is one of many enlisted personel in the camp. Klinger is a good
                                soldier,but he would rather be a good civilian. During most of his stay in Korea he
                                does his best to get a psychiatric discharge by wearing woman's dresses.

                            <li> Father Mulcahy is a camp priest who unlike the doctors who treat wounds on the body
                                does his best to help the persons soul. Nevertheless he likes to engage in such
                                activities the weekly poker game, betting etc. However anything he wins he donates to
                                the orphans.

                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            The life at 4077th is not just fun and games. Every day there is the inevitable moment
                            when the personel has to visit the mess tent and have their meal from World War 2 surplus.
                            But what beats anything is the war raging all around and an almost constant inflow of
                            wounded yound men coming in hoping that the doctors of the 4077th save their lives.
