                            Story follows life of the
                            4077th MASH (MASH is short for Mobile Army Surgical Hospital) during Korean
                            war in years 1950-1953. However this unit is not the military outfit someone would
                            expect. When not on duty the local medical personel engages in activities varying
                            from playing golf in a minefield, to performing practical jokes on anyone. But their
                            most distinct characteristic is complete lack of discipline. Best described by the
                            main hero, Doctor Hawkeye Pierce and his best friend Doctor Trapper John who are not
                            afraid to tell anyone, not even a general, what they think without any fear. In their
                            tent called "The Swamp" they assembled their very own still which they use to supply
                            the whole camp with gin. The roommate of Hawkeye and Trapper is Major Frank Burns.
                            Frank is an extremly patriotic, rule following but somewhat cowardly doctor. He is
                            often made fun of because of his surgical incompetence and being very annoying to
                            everone else. Commander of the camp is Lt. Colonel Henry Blake, a good
                            doctor but an indecisive leader, who is aided by Corporal "Radar" O'Reilly an 18-year
                            old kid from Iowa with a special ability who no one can really understand, he can
                            tell what's going to happen or what is someone going to say before it happens.
